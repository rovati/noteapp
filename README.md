# Welcome to Notes
Welcome! Notes is a simple but effective app for taking plain text notes and making check lists.</br>
This project was started by [Rova](https://github.com/rovati) as a little playground to learn a new programming language, but quickly evolved to the idea of having a finished, working product. Notes is and always will be an open-source and non-profit project, please refer to the _Licensing and forking_ section for more info about these subjects.

## Features
At the moment the development of the projects is fully focused on the Android application, even though drafts for a web-app are in progress.

In the first version of the Android app, the following features were introduced:
- access the notes from a main page that shows the list of all locally saved notes
- create new plaintext notes through a minimal toolbar
- edit notes title and content
- delete notes from the main page

Version 2 of the Android app introduced these additional features:
- keep track of lists using checklists: tap on the boxes to mark an item as completed
- pin notes to keep them at the top of your list

Version 3 is currently under development and the following features are planned:
- rework of the UI
- let the user decide the app theme through a list of predefined themes
- add the option of creating an account for cloud syncing of the notes and syncing across devices

## Repo structure
Starting from version 3 of the Android app it has been deided to revisit the organization of the repo. It is possible to access old code of the Android app through an "archive" branch [android-prev-versions](https://github.com/rovati/noteapp/tree/android-prev-versions). The currrent development of the Android app is found in the branch [android-app](https://github.com/rovati/noteapp/tree/android_app) while the _main_ branhc is kept only as a welcome page.
