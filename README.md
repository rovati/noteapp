# Welcome to Notes
Welcome! Notes is a simple but effective app for taking plain text notes and making check lists.</br>
This project was started by [Rova](https://github.com/rovati) as a little playground to learn a new programming language, but quickly evolved to the idea of having a finished, working product. Notes is and always will be an open-source and non-profit project, please refer to the _Licensing and forking_ section for more info about these subjects.

## Features
For the first release, the following features were planned:
- access the notes from a main page that shows the list of all locally saved notes
- create new notes through a minimal toolbar
- edit notes title and content
- delete notes from the main page

Version 2 of the app introduced these additional features:
- keep track of lists using checklists: tap on the boxes to mark an item as completed
- pin notes to keep them at the top of your list

For future releases, the following features will be added:
- add the possibility to create an account and store notes in cloud (cloud backup, and support for multiple devices)

There also are plans to release a web-app and two desktop clients (linux and windows).
